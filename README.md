# Autonomous_mobile_robotic_arm
Autonomous mobile manipulators (AMMs) support modern industries in handling, inspection, and logistics. This work presents a vision-based AMM using Fusion 360 design, URDF, ROS2, and PyBullet. A camera enables visual SLAM, A* gives collision-free paths, and a 4-DOF arm performs object tasks, offering a low-cost, efficient Industry 4.0 solution.
